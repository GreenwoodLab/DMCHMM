#' @description A part of BS-Seq data for three cell type:
#' WGBS data were derived from whole blood collected on a cohort of healthy
#' individuals from Sweden. Cell lines were separated into T-cells (19 samples),
#'  monocytes (13 samples) and B-cells (8 samples). Sequencing was performed on
#'  the Illumina HiSeq2000/2500 system for each of the 40 samples, separately.
#'  For illustration only 3 samples each containg 30,440 CpG sites around
#'  BLK gene are provided here. The whole data are analyzed in the cited paper.
